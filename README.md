# AzDoWorkItemForm

This project allows you to create dynamically generated form, based on the fields you want the end user to submit. 

Match one or more field names against a title in the docker environment variables. When the form loads, it queries Azure DevOps for the fields specified, if found it generates an appropraite HTML input. Single line text / Multi line text / multi select option.
